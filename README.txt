It is a 'Tomato Timer' or 'Pomodoro Clock', which is a time management technique. 

Here is the description from Wikipedia:

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro meaning "tomato". The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
